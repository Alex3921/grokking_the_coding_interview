// Statement:
// You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. 
// You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many 
// fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

// You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. 
// The farm has following restrictions:

// Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
// You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., 
// you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

// Step1: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']

// Step2: 
// need to keep track of how many fruits are in my baskets
// keep track of maximum number of fruits that we have
// use for loop to iterate over the array
// store every element and the times we see it
// when we meet a third distinct element empty one basket and store the new element

// Step3: 
// [] return 0
// ["a"] return 1
// ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'] return 3

// Step4:

    const baskets = {};

      while(Object.keys(baskets).length > 2) {
        const leftFruit = arr[winStart];

  // Step5:
